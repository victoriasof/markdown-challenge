   #### A funny story 
   
   When I finished school I was not sure what to do with my life. 
   I was inclined to study IT at a technical institute, 
   but my teacher persuaded me to go to shipping university.
   I also tried to get into art school but failed the exam.
   10 years later I am living in Antwerp, making a career switch.
   I am studying web development full time at BeCode, 
   as well as painting part-time at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.
   
   ##### TL;DR It's never too late to start over 

   Searching for my purpose
